Event-Based Networking Framework
============================

This file is part of the networking module https://github.com/cgloeckner/networking. The project offers an event-based networking framework for games and other software. It's main purpose is to integrate into my own game project as well as integrate it into FLARE by Clint Bellanger one day.

Limitations:
----------

Events mustn't contain pointers or other high-level data which are based on pointers. This limitation is founded in the easy way the system is sending and receiving data over the network. There is no serialization of given events. Therefore each event has to use primitive value types only. Remember to serialize and unserialize all data on your own before inserting these data into your derived event.


Building:
--------

To build the module and simple demo application using gcc you can use:

    g++ -o demo src/*.cpp example1.cpp -lSDL -lSDL_net --std=c++0x

To build the module and more complex demo application using gcc you can use:

    g++ -o demo src/*.cpp example2.cpp -lSDL -lSDL_net --std=c++0x

I testet it using GNU/Linux Ubuntu 12.04 32-Bit and gcc 4.6.3.


Scheduled Changes:
----------------

    pure udp-based server-client (current server-client is pure tcp-based)

    much more detailed testing

    client-client architecture

    fix memory lecks when exceptions are thrown

    alternative to malloc before receiving data (should be freed, not deleted)

    use size_t for length of bytes (not different types)

    virtual void Event::serialize() und virtual bool Event::deserialize()
